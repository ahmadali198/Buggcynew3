    * - fill: The image is sized to fill the element's content box. The entire image will fill the box, but it will be stretched or squashed to fit.
    * - scale-down: The image is sized as if `none` or `contain` were selected, whichever would result in a smaller concrete object size.
    * - none: The image is not resized.
